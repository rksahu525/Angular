Ex: grid-row and grid-column  for designing layouts.
      
grid-column - it specifies the fraction [fr] and 
	     placement of content in defined column.

 grid-row      - It specifies the row number and
	      places the content in defined row

  Note:  If the container is 900px 
              grid-template-columns  : 1fr  3fr
             It defines into 3 columns [fractions] 
             Starting with 1 and ending with 3.
