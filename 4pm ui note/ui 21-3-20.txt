Frame by Frame Animation
- Frame   : It is the location where we have to keep
	and animate any object. [object is in stage                  and controlled from frame for animation]

- Static Frame:  In this the object will continue but
	         will not have any animation. You can
	         insert static frame by using "F5" 
	         function key.

- Key Frame  : In this the object will continue with
	       animation. You can insert key frame
	       by using "F6" function key.

Tweening Animation:
 - In tween animation we have to design only the starting and changing points. 
 - Flash will design all other frames in between the points automatically.
 - Tween animation is 2 types
            a) Motion Tween
            b) Shape Tween
 - Motion tween to change position, size, roate.
 - Shape Tween to change the shape i.e from one object to another.
