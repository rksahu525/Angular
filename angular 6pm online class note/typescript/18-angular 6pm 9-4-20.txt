How Ploymorphism is given for component in OOP?
- Polymorphism in computer programming is the process of allocating different types of memory for single component. so that it can handle different behaviors and functionalities.

- Polymorphism is the process where a single base class object uses the memory of multiple derived classes.


Ex:
class Employee {
    public FirstName:string;
    public LastName:string;
    public Designation:string;
    public Print():void {
        console.log(`${this.FirstName} ${this.LastName} - ${this.Designation}`);
    }
}
class Developer extends Employee {
    public Print():void {
        super.FirstName = "Raj";
        super.LastName = "Kumar";
        super.Designation = "Developer";
        super.Print();
    }
}
class Consultant extends Employee {
    public Print():void {
        super.FirstName = "Kiran";
        super.LastName = "Rao";
        super.Designation= "Consultant";
        super.Print();
    }
}
class Manager extends Employee {
    public Print():void {
        super.FirstName = "Tom";
        super.LastName = "Hanks";
        super.Designation= "Manager";
        super.Print();
    }
}
let employees:Employee[] = [new Developer(), new Consultant(), new Manager()];
for(var employee of employees) {
    employee.Print();
}
		 (or)
let employees:Employee[] = [];
employees[0] = new Developer();
employees[1] = new Consultant();
employees[2] = new Manager();

for(var emp of employees) {
    emp.Print();
}
