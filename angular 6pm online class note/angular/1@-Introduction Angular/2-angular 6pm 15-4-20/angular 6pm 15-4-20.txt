	       Angular Architecture 
	       [High Level Design]

- Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page and progressive client-applications using HTML and TypeScript.

- Angular is written in TypeScript

- Angular Architecture completly relies on the following components.
	a) Modules
	b) Services
	c) Template
	d) Component
	e) Metadata
	f) Directive

Modules:
- Angular uses "NgModules" 
- NgModule declares compilation context for a set of components.
- Module comprises of related types of classes
- Class comprises of data and logic.
- NgModule is the root module for Angular.
- Several Predefined modules are provided by angular library
	@angular/core

	@angular/animations etc..
Injector:
- Injector injects the modules into service.

Service:
- Service is a pre-defined business logic
- It is a set of related type of factory functions.
- Service uses a "Singleton" pattern.

Component:
- Components are building blocks for angular application
- Component is injected with functions from services.
- Component can be defined with custom functions.
- Component comprises of HTML , CSS and Logic in typescript.

Tempate:
- A template comprises of components
- It manages functionalities like "Property" binding, Event Binding etc.
- A template configure the components using meta data.

Directive:
- A directive refers to template
