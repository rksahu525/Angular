	Property and Attributte Binding
- Attributes are associated with Tags
- Properties are associated with Elements.
- HTML is a collection of Elements.
- Elements are presented statically by using tags.

	    <img src="">
	      src → attribute

- Elements are presented dynamically by using built-in objects [ classes ].

	    var pic  = new Image();
	    pic.src = " ";

	    src → property

- Every attribute of HTML tag doesn't have relative property.
                  <table>  can use  "colspan" attribute
		          but
	 Dynamically there is no colspan property

- Angular allows to bind data to the properties directly, which is know as "Property Binding".

- HTML properties are defined in "[ ]" so that angular can identify the properties and bind a value.

Syntax:
	     public  username = "John";
	     <input type="text" [value]="username">
	     <h2 [innerHTML]="username"> </h2>

- Angular can't bind values dynamically to attributes directly, it can bind to properties only.

Syntax:
	public mergeCount = 2;
	
	<th [colspan]="mergeCount">  // invalid

	colspan → isn't a known property of "th" 

- Angular allows any dynamic value to be binded with an attribute by using the prefix "attr".
           
Syntax:
	public mergeCount = 2;

	<th [attr.colspan]="mergeCount">  //valid

- Angular 7+  versions provide built-in dynamic properties for HTML elements, which you can use for databinding.

Syntax:
	public mergeCount = 2;

	<th [colSpan]="mergeCount">  //valid

	colSpan → is an angular property
