- Angular Application starts with "Index.html" 
- Index.html is defined in "src" folder.
- Index page is injected with components.
- Index page will display the startup component that you have defined.

	        Angular Component
-  Components are building-blocks for angular application.
- Component comprises of 
	a) User Interface (UI)
	b) Logic
	c) Styles
- UI is designed with HTML
- Logic is defined with TypeScript
- Styles are defined with CSS
- Every component of Angular is built with 3 files and tested with 1 file i.e a component comprises of following files
     a)  component.html	[ UI ]
     b)  component.ts      	[ TypeScript Logic]
     c)  component.css   	[ Styles ]
     d)  component.spec.ts  	[Specification-testing]
			    for unit testing
- Angular component can designed by using 2 techniques:
	1. Inline documentation technique
	2. Code behind technique	

- Inline documentation technique is an approach where UI, Logic and styles all are kept in one file. That file will have the extention ".ts".

- Code Behind Technique is an approach where UI, Logic and styles are separated for each other. It is easy for extensibility, reusability, mantainability, testablility.
		a) HTML
		b) CSS
		c) TS

Note: If several number of files are used for a single component request then it will take more time to load.

- Technically a component is a TypeScript class.
- Every component requires a set or properties and methods which are derived from "Component" base class defined in "@angular/core" library.

 Syntax:
   import  {  Component } from  '@angular/core';

   export class HomeComponent
   {

   }

Note: Any application can understand and use your component with the help of "MetaData".

- Every component requires meta data.
- Meta data is used by angular application to understand your component, compile and process.
- Component Metadata is defined by using
	@Component({ 

	})

Syntax for Component:
===================
	        home.component.ts
  import { Component } from '@angular/core';
  @Component({
       // metadata here..
   })
  export class HomeComponent 
  {
      // logic here..
  } 

- Every component must be designed and stored in "src/app" folder.

- After designing the component you have to register the component.

Note: Every Module, Service, Pipe, component that you design for angular application can't be used directly. You have to register them in the "app.module.ts" present in "src\app" folder.
