	          Angular Data Binding
- Data Binding is a technique that specifies how angular application binds data to UI, and how it can access data and manipulate data.

- Angular implements Architectural Patterns like "MVC, MVP and MVVM" client side.

	             What is MVC
	             ===========
- OOP started in early 1960's
- Johan Olay, Kristian Nygaard OOP - SIMULA 67
- Code Reusability Concerns
- 1970's  Trygve introduced MVC as a part of "Small Talk".
- Code Separation Concerns
- MVC separates application into 3 components
	a) Model		- Data
	b) View		- UI
	c) Controller	- Application Logic
- The major features of MVC framework
	a) Code reusability
	b) Code separation
	c) Extensibility
	d) Loosely coupled
	e) Testability - Unit Testing
- Serveral Technologies are using "MVC" framework

Model: 
- Represents the data we are working with
- It defines business specific logic
- It comprises of Business objects known as "POJO"  [Plain Old JavaScript Objects].
- It is data in general
- Model can't directly send data to view or can't accept data from view.

View:
- It represents application UI
- It is a template that renders HTML
- It presents the data.
- It is markup in general
- In angular application View represent "component.html".

Controller:
- It is core MVC component
- It controlls the overall application flow
- It handles communication between view and model.
- It contains application specific logic.
- In angular application controller represents
	"component.ts"

	                  MVVM
	      [Model-View- ViewModel]
- In MVVM framework a "ViewModel" is responsible  for handling the overall communication.
- ViewModel comprises of logic that is required to handle communication between Model and View.
- In this framework Model can update directly to View and View and update to Model.
